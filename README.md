# Intel® AI Quantization Tools for Tensorflow*

> Note:Intel® AI Quantization Tools for Tensorflow* are experimental and under active development.


This repo contains tools to ease the data scientist's work.

* [Tensorflow Quantization](tensorflow_quantization/README.md#quantization-tools):
  Post-training model quantization and optimization can help reduce the size of your model
  and run inference faster, while maintaining accuracy.
* [Quantization Python Programming API](api/README.md#quantization-python-programming-api-examples-with-resnet50):
  The quantization python programming API is an unified python interface of Tensorflow Quantization tools to improve the user experience.
