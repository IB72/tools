# Intel AI Quantization Tools

> Note: Intel AI Quantization Tools are experimental and under active development.


This repo contains tools to ease the data scientist's work.

* [Tensorflow Quantization](tensorflow_quantization/README.md#quantization-tools):
  Post-training model quantization and optimization can help reduce the size of your model
  and run inference faster, while maintaining accuracy.
